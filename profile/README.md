# 🌍🚀 **SpaceGuardian - Guiding Satellites, Shaping Tomorrow**  

Welcome to **SpaceGuardian**, where we are redefining the future of space traffic management. Our mission is simple yet vital: preventing satellite collisions through intelligent automation. With over 30 satellites launched every week, space is getting increasingly crowded, and the risks are rising. We go beyond monitoring to automate collision avoidance, optimize maneuvers, and extend satellite lifespans.

## 💡 The Problem  

Low-Earth orbit (LEO) is on the brink of congestion. Current solutions track potential collisions but rely on outdated communication protocols and manual decision-making. These inefficiencies lead to:  

- Slow and error-prone responses  
- Unnecessary fuel consumption, shortening satellite lifespans  
- Increased risk of space debris, worsening the problem for all operators

## 🛰️ The Solution - SpaceGuardian  

We created **SpaceGuardian**, a subscription-based SaaS platform for automatic satellite collision prevention and maneuver optimization.  

- Proactively predicts potential collisions through real-time trajectory analysis and space debris tracking  
- Automates maneuver execution for efficient threat avoidance while optimizing fuel usage for long-term mission success  
- Utilizes data-driven risk assessment to enhance accuracy and minimize human intervention, reducing errors and improving operational efficiency  
- Enables automated threat mitigation, ensuring continuous satellite safety and mission reliability
